Endlink Web Automation Test Reports
This repository serves as a centralized hub for hosting and managing automated test reports generated by the Endlink Web Automation project. It leverages GitHub Pages to provide easy access to the latest test results and a historical archive of previous runs.

🚀 Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to:

Provide a single source of truth for all automated test execution reports.

Offer quick access to the most recent test run's results.

Maintain a historical record of test outcomes for analysis and tracking trends.

Enable effortless sharing of test reports with the team and stakeholders.

📁 Repository Structure
The repository has a straightforward and organized structure:

.
├── .github/workflows/           (Optional: if you have report-specific workflows)
├── latest/                      (Contains the report of the most recent test run)
├── reports/                     (Contains timestamped reports of past runs)
│   ├── {BUILD_NUMBER}_{TIMESTAMP}_{ENVIRONMENT}/
│   │   ├── ExtentReport.html
│   │   ├── index.html           (Duplicate of ExtentReport.html for GitHub Pages)
│   │   └── ... (other report assets like images, CSS, JS)
│   ├── ...
├── README.md                    (This file)

Key Directories:
latest/: This directory is automatically updated with the full report of the most recent test execution. It is designed for quick access to the latest status.

Access URL: https://prathameshgeek.github.io/endlink-test-reports/latest/

reports/: This directory stores individual test reports, each within a folder named using the build number, timestamp, and environment (e.g., 123_2024-06-24_15-30_QA). Reports older than 30 days are automatically cleaned up to manage repository size.

Access URL (example): https://prathameshgeek.github.io/endlink-test-reports/reports/{BUILD_NUMBER}_{TIMESTAMP}_{ENVIRONMENT}/

⚙️ How Reports Are Generated and Published
The reports are generated by a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline and automatically pushed to this repository. The pipeline performs the following key steps:

Clones the main Endlink Web Automation codebase.

Executes the Selenium tests against the specified environment (QA or Production).

Captures the test results and generates an Extent Report.

Clones this endlink-test-reports repository.

Cleans up old reports (older than 30 days) from the reports/ directory.

Copies the newly generated report into a timestamped, environment-specific folder within reports/.

Updates the latest/ directory with the contents of the new report.

Commits and pushes the changes back to this repository, triggering GitHub Pages to update the hosted reports.

🔗 Accessing the Reports
You can access the test reports directly via GitHub Pages:

Latest Report:
https://prathameshgeek.github.io/endlink-test-reports/latest/

Specific Historical Report:
Navigate to the reports/ directory in this repository and click on the desired build folder (e.g., 123_2024-06-24_15-30_QA). You can then open the index.html or ExtentReport.html file directly in your browser or construct the URL based on the folder name.

📧 Email Notifications
The Jenkins pipeline is configured to send email notifications after each build, including a direct link to the latest report for quick review.
